# Arduino pluggable discovery reference implementation

The `dummy-discovery` tool is a command line program that interacts via stdio. It accepts commands as plain ASCII strings terminated with LF `\n` and sends response as JSON.
The "communication ports" returned by the tool are fake, this discovery is intenteded only for educational and testing purposes.

## How to build

Install a recent go environment and run `go build`. The executable `dummy-discovery` will be produced in your working directory.

## Usage

After startup, the tool waits for commands. The available commands are: `HELLO`, `START`, `STOP`, `QUIT`, `LIST` and `START_SYNC`.

#### HELLO command

The `HELLO` command is used to establish the pluggable discovery protocol between client and discovery.
The format of the command is:

`HELLO <PROTOCOL_VERSION> "<USER_AGENT>"`

for example:

`HELLO 1 "Arduino IDE"`

or:

`HELLO 1 "arduino-cli"`

in this case the protocol version requested by the client is `1` (at the moment of writing there were no other revisions of the protocol).
The response to the command is:

```json
{
  "eventType": "hello",
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "message": "OK"
}
```

`protocolVersion` is the protocol version that the discovery is going to use in the remainder of the communication.

#### START command

The `START` starts the internal subroutines of the discovery that looks for ports. This command must be called before `LIST` or `START_SYNC`. The response to the start command is:

```json
{
  "eventType": "start",
  "message": "OK"
}
```

#### STOP command

The `STOP` command stops the discovery internal subroutines and free some resources. This command should be called if the client wants to pause the discovery for a while. The response to the stop command is:

```json
{
  "eventType": "stop",
  "message": "OK"
}
```

#### QUIT command

The `QUIT` command terminates the discovery. The response to quit is:

```json
{
  "eventType": "quit",
  "message": "OK"
}
```

after this output the tool quits.

#### LIST command

The `LIST` command returns a list of the currently available serial ports. The format of the response is the following:

```json
{
  "eventType": "list",
  "ports": [
    {
      "address": "1",
      "label": "Dummy upload port",
      "protocol": "dummy",
      "protocolLabel": "Dummy protocol",
      "properties": {
        "mac": "73622384782",
        "pid": "0x0041",
        "vid": "0x2341"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### START_SYNC command

The `START_SYNC` command puts the tool in "events" mode: the discovery will send `add` and `remove` events each time a new port is detected or removed respectively.
The immediate response to the command is:

```json
{
  "eventType": "start_sync",
  "message": "OK"
}
```

after that the discovery enters in "events" mode.

The `add` events looks like the following:

```json

  "eventType": "add",
  "port": {
    "address": "4",
    "label": "Dummy upload port",
    "protocol": "dummy",
    "protocolLabel": "Dummy protocol",
    "properties": {
      "mac": "294489539128",
      "pid": "0x0041",
      "vid": "0x2341"
    }
  }
}
```

it basically gather the same information as the `list` event but for a single port. After calling `START_SYNC` a bunch of `add` events may be generated in sequence to report all the ports available at the moment of the start.

The `remove` event looks like this:

```json
{
  "eventType": "remove",
  "port": {
    "address": "4",
    "protocol": "dummy"
  }
}
```

in this case only the `address` and `protocol` fields are reported.

### Example of usage

A possible transcript of the discovery usage:

```
HELLO 1 "arduino-cli"
{
  "eventType": "hello",
  "message": "OK",
  "protocolVersion": 1
}
START
{
  "eventType": "start",
  "message": "OK"
}
LIST
{
  "eventType": "list",
  "ports": [
    {
      "address": "1",
      "label": "Dummy upload port",
      "protocol": "dummy",
      "protocolLabel": "Dummy protocol",
      "properties": {
        "mac": "73622384782",
        "pid": "0x0041",
        "vid": "0x2341"
      }
    }
  ]
}
STOP
{
  "eventType": "stop",
  "message": "OK"
}
START_SYNC
{
  "eventType": "start_sync",
  "message": "OK"
}
{
  "eventType": "add",
  "port": {
    "address": "2",

      "pid": "0x0041",
      "vid": "0x2341"
    }
  }
}
